# 🍷 Hometown Liquors

Hometown Liquors is a modern, full-featured e-commerce platform for a local liquor store. It’s built to help my dad's business transition smoothly into the digital space, enabling online browsing, in-store pickup orders, customer engagement, and future analytics all while maintaining compliance with age restrictions.

## 🛠️ What is This Project For?

This website was built for my family’s **Hometown-Liquors** liquor store, allowing customers to:

- Browse products on mobile or desktop
- Place orders online for in-store pickup
- Get notified about low stock, restocks, or new arrivals
- Manage their favorite items and view past online orders
- Leave and read product reviews

It’s designed with real-world business operations in mind — while giving me an opportunity to scale my technical skills across frontend, backend, and cloud integrations.
